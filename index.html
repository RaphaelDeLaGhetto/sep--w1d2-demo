        <h1>Everyone Wants a Rocket Stove!</h1>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.appropedia.org/Rocket_stoves" target="_blank">Rockets stoves</a> are designed to generate more heat from less wood. They
            produce ahot, low emission flame that can be used for cooking or heating.
            Through experimentation I will determine the most appropriate way to 
            apply this technology in the Calgary context.

        <h2>They come in all shapes and sizes</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Appropriate technology</em> is that which is sustainable, locally 
            sourced, and low maintenace. Depending on where you are in the world,
            you may see rocket stoves constructed out of steel, cob, concrete, or
            even dug out of the ground.
